i need to demo how i did this eu_dashboard in projects/eu_dashboard with the help of Generative AI.
The literal ask was 'I need you to demo how GenAI helped create the dashboard \ Claude used to improve it.'

Time allocated is 15 minutes. Take me a script how i can do this, like like with this project.
 see example prompt below. meaybe after creations ask to enhance, or add extra functionality to this app.

Create the presentation script in md format, but be informal and can also be fun.
create sample prompts we can use, below is just an example:

create a new project in /projects/demoGenAI. Take the 3 most interesting csv files we have in
 /projects/eu_dashboard/data and copy them over to a subfolder in this new project
tell me what can we do with these numbers to show in react app.
We want to publish this on azure as a static web app, so create a github actions flow file
 for that we will use azure deployment key.
also add 2 shell scripts, first one create repo on github, and add current files, 
ask for repo name, check if it already exists, if not create it, then a second shell script file which adds it so git add ., then do a commit message (ask it as input), then push it, tell if successfull or not
create one md file where you explain the app, how to use each file, how to start this app.
